1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
   ==> Describe() creates a block that groups together several related tests in one "test suite". It is not required but it is useful to visualize/manage and oragnize tests into groups. Whereas, it() creates test method which is useful for running a test.

2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
   ==> TDD is a software development process which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring. It is the one way to think through your requirements and/or design before writing the functional code.

3. Mention three types of automated tests.
   ==> Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing
